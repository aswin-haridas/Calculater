Title: Simple Calculator App with Flutter

Description:
This project is a simple calculator application developed using Flutter, a popular cross-platform UI toolkit. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as percentage calculations. It provides a user-friendly interface for entering mathematical expressions and viewing the result.

Features:
1. Arithmetic Operations: Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by inputting numeric values and selecting the corresponding operator buttons.
2. Percentage Calculation: The calculator includes a percentage (%) button, allowing users to calculate percentages easily.
3. Parentheses Support: The calculator supports parentheses for grouping expressions, enabling users to perform complex calculations accurately.
4. Clear and Delete Functionality: Users can clear the input field with a single tap using the "C" button, and delete the last entered character with the "DEL" button.
5. Responsive Design: The application is designed to adapt to various screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices.

Implementation:
- The user interface is built using Flutter's Material Design components, providing a modern and intuitive look.
- Mathematical expressions entered by the user are parsed and evaluated using the `math_expressions` library, which supports complex arithmetic calculations.
- The calculator's functionality is implemented using stateful widgets to manage user input and update the display dynamically.
- Operator buttons are styled differently from numeric buttons for better visual distinction, enhancing usability.

Usage:
Users can download the source code from the GitHub repository and run the application on their local development environment using Flutter SDK. They can input mathematical expressions by tapping on the numeric and operator buttons, and view the result in real-time. The calculator provides a convenient tool for performing quick calculations on mobile devices.

Future Enhancements:
- Support for more advanced mathematical functions such as square root, exponentiation, and trigonometric functions.
- History feature to track and recall previous calculations.
- Customization options for themes and button layouts to cater to different user preferences.

Contributions:
Contributions and feedback from the open-source community are welcome to improve the functionality, performance, and user experience of the calculator application. Developers can contribute by fixing bugs, implementing new features, or optimizing the codebase for better performance.
